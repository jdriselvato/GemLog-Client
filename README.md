A simple musical note quiz game.

I want to learn how to read music. I got the basics of it but I also wanted to learn the ins and outs of all parts of sheet music. At the same time, I wanted a small macOS app to quiz myself on the notes. I also had to learn how to use [PySimpleGUI](https://www.pysimplegui.org) (I wanted to to be cross platform).

The code is very crude and I barely write python, no less GUI apps for it but it gets the job done.

-----

You'll need to install `PySimpleGUI`

```
pip install pysimplegui
or
pip3 install pysimplegui
```

## basic_staff_with_notes.py (v0.001)

I had to wrap my head around how I was going to show all the notes between D4 and G5 so first made a basic staff with all the notes.
