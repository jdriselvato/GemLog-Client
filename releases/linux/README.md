The client executable works natively on linux but if you run into issues, visit `/source/` and run the client via `python3 client.py`. 
I package the modules inside the executable, so it should work but as this is my first crossplatform app (Ever) I don't know what kind of snags we'll run into with linux.

If you do run into an issue running this executable create an issue on github:
